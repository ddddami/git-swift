```bash
brew tap ddddami/gitch
brew install gitch
```

### From source

```bash
go install github.com/ddddami/swift-git@latest
```

## Usage

### Interactive mode
Simply run:

```bash
gitch
```

This opens an interactive UI where you can:
- Type to filter branches
- Use ‚Üë/‚Üì arrows to navigate
- Press Enter to switch to the selected branch
- Press Esc to quit

```

This will switch directly to the branch if an exact match is found.
